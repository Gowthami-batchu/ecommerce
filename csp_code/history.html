                    Kondapalli is an industrial town near Vijayawada city, Andhra Pradesh, India with nearly 38000 population covering an area of 1.5 sq kilometers. It is about 20 km by 
                    road from Vijayawada on National Highway 221 and on Hyderabad – Vijayawada railway line.
             The word Kondapalli gets its name from the shepherd named <b>Kondadu</b> who showed the site to King <b>Kondaveedu Reddy</b> and hence it was called Kondapalli. The town is 
                 known for two major things i.e. ancient <b>Kondapalli Fort</b> and its locally-made toy craft Kondapalli bommalu (Kondapalli toys). 
                 ‘Kondapalli Fort’ of three storeys was built in this place during the region of <b>King Anavema Reddy</b> in 1360 A.D. It was however during the rule of the Qutab 
                  Shahis that Kondapalli gained paramount importance and fame as a hill fortress. The 37 Sultans re-christened it as <b>Mustafanagar</b>. 
                  Later, the British East India Company considered it a strategic location and a military school existed here till 1859 
                  (as revealed by the historic records of Andhra Pradesh in general and Vijayawada in particular).

                    The fort is located to the west of Vijayawada city in the main hill range known as Kondapalli in the Krishna district.
     The hill range, about <b>24 kilometres</b> (15 mi) in length, extends between <b>Nandigama</b> and <b>Vijayawada</b> . 
     The forest area in this hill range abounds in a type of lightwood known as <b>'ponuku' పొనుకు కఱ్ఱ </b>(Gyrocapus jacquini), which is used 
        exclusively for the manufacture of the famous Kondpalli toys. 
     The forest vegetation around Kondapalli fort and the nearby hills are also well known for medicinal plants and trees such as Phyllanthus amarus 
        (Telugu local name "nela usiri" నేల <b>ఉసిరిక చెట్టు</b>), Phyllanthus, Andrographis paniculata (local name: "adavi mirapa" <b>అడవి మిరప</b> or "nelavemu" <b>నేలవేము</b>), 
        Thedlapala (Wrightia tinctoria), Tephrosia purpurea, Albizia amara, Streulia urens and Chloroxylon swetenia.
     The hill range is mainly made up of <b>charnockites</b>, with some pyroxene granulites, granites, khondalites, pyroxenites and dolerites.

                    The fort was built in 1360 CE by Anna Vemareddy of the Kondaveedu Reddy dynasty after he captured Kondapalli from Mudigonda Chalaukyas.
                    In the historic struggle for power for the throne of Gajapati kingdom, Hamvira had to fight his brother Purushottam, who had succeeded to the throne after their father's death. 
                    He sought the help of the Bahmani Sultan in this war. He was successful in defeating his brother and occupied the throne of Gajapati kingdom, in 1472. 
                    But in the bargain, he gave Kondapalli and Rajahmundry to the Bahmani Sultan. Subsequently, Purushottam defeated Hamvira in 1476 and occupied the throne of Gajapati. 
                    But it is also said that in 1476, a revolution began at Kondapalli when there was famine in the Bahmani kingdom. The garrison of Kondapalli revolted and gave possession of the 
                    fort to "Hamer Oriya" or Hamvira.
              <br>
                       Purushottam, once he became the king, tried to get back Kondapalli and Rajahmundry from the Bahmani Sultan III. But when he held siege over Rajamundry, for some unknown reason 
                    he signed a peace treaty with the Sultan, which resulted in souring of relations between Bahmani and Vijayanagar rulers, which resulted in minor battles. But in 1481, after the 
                    death of Sultan Mahammad, the Bahmani Sultanate was in disarray and taking advantage of this situation Purushottam fought with Mahmad Shah, the Sultan's son, and took control of 
                    Rajahmundry and Kondapalli fort.Gajapati Purushottam Deva died in 1497 and was succeeded by his son Gajapati Prataprudra Deva.
              <br>
                          In 1509, Gajapati Prataprudra Deva started a war against Krishnadevaraya of Vijayanagar Empire, but Gajapati had to retreat to the north to defend an attack by 
                   Sultan Allauddin Hussan Shah of Bengal. The consequence was that Krishnadevaraya had an easy victory over Kondapalli, which he occupied in June 1515. In the last war fought in 1519, 
                   Krishnadevaraya once again defeated the Gajapati ruler. Since the Kondaveedu fortress was very strong, after three months siege of the fort, Krishnadevaraya had to personally direct 
                   the operations to get control of the fort. Following this war, Krishnadevaraya married Gajapati Prataprudra Deva's daughter, Kalinga Kumari Jaganmohini. A treaty was also signed for 
                   restoring all land up to the southern boundary of the Krishna River to Orissa, which included Kondapalli.
              <br>
                           But after the treaty with Vijayanagara emperor, between 1519 and 1525, Gajapati Prataprudra Deva had to defend his territory against invasion by Sultan Quli Qutab, the Sultan 
                   of Golkonda. But in the final assault, in 1531, Kondapalli came under the rule of Sultan of Golkonda. The war with Golkonda Sultans was continued by Govinda Bidyadhar, the new ruler 
                   of the Gajapati Kingdom who had succeeded Gajapati Prataprudra Deva (who died in 1533) but ended finally with a treaty with the Sultan.
              <br>
                           The area came under Mughal rule in the 17th century. After the disintegration of the Mughal Empire in the early 18th century, Nizam ul-Mulk, what later became the Nizam of 
                   Hyderabad declared independence and took the area under its control. In the late 18th century, the area was still under the Nizam's rule, a treaty of alliance was signed between 
                   Nizam Ali and the British East India Company recognizing the control of the British over the territory. This treaty was initially signed on 12 November 1766 under which the company 
                   in return for the grant of the territory agreed to garrison troops in the fort for Nizam's aid at an annual cost of 90,000 pounds. It is also stated that in 1766 the British, under 
                   General Caillaud, stormed the fort and took control of it.
              
              <br>
                             A second treaty was signed on 1 March 1768, under which the Nizam recognized the grant provided to the British by Mughal ruler Shah Alam. But, as a gesture of friendship, 
                   the British (then the East India Company) agreed to pay an allowance of 50,000 pounds to the Nizam. However, in 1823, the East India Company rested total control of the Sarcars 
                   under an outright purchase from the Nizam.
                   In the initial years, the fort was used as a business center but after the British took over the fort in 1766 it was converted into a military training base.
              <br>
                        In India, the oldest toys belong to the 5000 year-old Harappan civilisation. These toys were made with natural materials like clay, wood and stone. 
                    They depicted ordinary men, women, animals, birds, fruits and vegetables as well as the important professionals who existed in those times - the potter,
                  carpenter and farmer, among others. Many regions in India specialize in making ancient toys. In the southern state of Andhra Pradesh for instance, the names of places such 
                  as Kondapalli, Nirmal, Ettikoppakka and Tirupati, are associated with wooden toys crafted with great style. The artisans are not only experienced but are also well versed in 
                   the theoretical aspects. They have adopted the South Indian style of architecture of wood, which is evident in their work. The popular classical collection includes Dasavatars,
                  the Gitopadesa, and events associated with the life of Lord Krishna. The mythological toys pose a great challenge, as they require skill in portraying half-human and half-animal god figures.
              <br>
                  Every ancient monument or artistic structure has a history, and so does this fort. Located in the Guntur district of Vijayawada near a picturesque valley, it was built by 
                  Musunuri Nayaks in the 14th century. Since then, it has been of great importance. When the son of Gajapati Kapilendra Deva, Hamvira, wanted to defeat his brother, Purushottam, 
                  and win Orissa, he took help from the Bahamany king.                                                    
              <br>
                  He was successful but lost Kondapalli, the village got stuck with famine, and then Purshottam tried to win it back again. The Bahamany king was held captive, and they had to sign a 
                  treaty with Purshottam. His son, Prataprudra, then ruled the village. However, when the Mughals attacked, in 1767, the Britishers used Kondapalli Fort as a military training base camp.
